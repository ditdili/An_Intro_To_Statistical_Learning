## Bayesian Methods for Hackers
### Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference

In this folder I collected my notes while studying the book [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://www.informit.com/store/bayesian-methods-for-hackers-probabilistic-programming-9780133902839) by Cameron Davidson-Pilon. The notes are of Jupyter Notebooks format.

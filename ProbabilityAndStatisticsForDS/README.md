## Probability and Statistics for Data Science

In this folder I collected my notes while studying the book [Probability and Statistics for Data Science](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/pages/DSGA1002_fall17/index.html) by Carlos Fernandez-Granda. The notes are in Jupyter Notebooks format.

The book is a compilation of notes that were developed for the course Probability and Statistics for Data Science at the
Center for Data Science in NYU.

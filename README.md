## An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Application in R

This repository contains my take on __'An Introduction to Statistical Leanring(ISL)'__ by G. James et al. The book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. The PDF of the book is available for free online on the books [website](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).

I was inspired by [JWarmenhoven](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python)'s ISLR github repository, and decided also work in __Python__, even though the examples, labs and exercises in the book are done using __R__. 

I used __numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn__ libraries in these notebooks.
